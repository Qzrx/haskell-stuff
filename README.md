haskell-stuff
=============

Assorted Haskell stuff for the Haskell lectures @ http://shuklan.com/haskell/index.html
* Lecture 2:
**   factorials; recursively and with product [2..n]
* Lecture 3:
**   home-made zip, rot13
  
  
Todo: Shuklan breaks down around the time monads/monoids come in to play; switch over to LYAH or Real World Haskell. Or both!
